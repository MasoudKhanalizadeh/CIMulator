# üß† CIMulator ‚Äî Computation-In-Memory Simulator
CIMulator is an interactive Jupyter-based simulator for **memristor devices** and **crossbar arrays**.  
It allows researchers, students, and engineers to explore **in-memory computing (CIM)** concepts with adjustable parameters, real-time plotting, and an intuitive graphical interface.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Single-cell memristor simulation** with customizable parameters:
  - Initial resistance **R0 (Œ©)**
  - Sensitivity constant **k (Œ©/C)**
  - Peak current **I0 (A)**
  - Input frequency **f (Hz)**
  - Duration and resolution
  - Waveform: *sine*, *square*, *triangle*
- **Interactive GUI with sliders** (via ipywidgets).
- **Real-time plots**:
  - Input current *i(t)*
  - Accumulated charge *q(t)*
  - Memristance *M(t)*
- Designed for **education, research, and prototyping** in neuromorphic and CIM domains.

## üöÄ Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/CIMulator.git
cd CIMulator
```
### 2. Install requirements
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib ipywidgets
```
Enable widgets in Jupyter (if not already enabled):
```bash
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```
### 3. Run in Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the notebook and adjust parameters with sliders.

## üìä Example Output
After running a simulation, you will see plots like:
- Input current over time
- Accumulated charge curve
- Dynamic memristance response

## üß© Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Crossbar Array Mode**: simulate N√óN memristor crossbars.  
- [ ] **Matrix‚ÄìVector Multiplication**: demonstrate `Y = W √ó X` in CIM hardware.  
- [ ] **AI Integration**: prototype small neural networks running on crossbar arrays.  
- [ ] **Export Tools**: numerical outputs (CSV/JSON) for analysis.  
- [ ] **Variability & Noise Models**: include non-idealities for realistic behavior.  
- [ ] **Unified GUI**: choose between Single-Cell, Crossbar, or AI mode from one dashboard.
